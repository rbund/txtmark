__René did a great job creating this library and I feel as I'm able to add some improvements to it. I will try to stick to his philosophy and keep all additions simple and performant.__

### What I really like about TxtMark

* It's fast.
* It's kept simple but efficient.
* It's easy to integrate into existing or new projects.
* I really like the coding style.
* more to come! :)
 
### What I think where some improvements might be helpful

* During my source review _(not yet finished)_ I found some bugs which should be fixed.
* Some more modularity for easier extensions.
* I'd like to see some parsing additions but without introducing "performance killer" like regular expressions.

All changes done by me will also apply to the Apache License, Version 2.0.

Best,
